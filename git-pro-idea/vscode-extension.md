VSCode plugin functionalities:
- [ ] Tracking your time per project and per issue (look at git remote and the branch name to know which one it is)
- [ ] Big green ship button in sidebar that ships all changes for every project in the workspace
- [ ] Select issues in the sidebar from the remote (or automatically look for issues assigned to you). This will show an instantly editable to-do per issue in the sidebar. Also create new issues from this view. Also update the status per issue from this view.
- [ ] Git branch watcher: Just a simple notification if anyone makes a commit to a branch you're currently working on.
