Any operations that control the system that are unrelated to the file-system and also unrelated to the King OS can be found here.

This collection was extracted from KingOS in 8-2024 and can maybe be used as an example or starting point to build something for this usecase of controlling mac.

NB: A lot of code requires a lot of dependencies because it was extracted from a monolith. This code does not run. Some CLIs do, but making it public is not meant to running or fixing it. Just to inspire.
