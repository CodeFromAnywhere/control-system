touch: touch seems fairly hard right now, except for touch of the keyboard

smell: the computer can't smell when I need a shower :( woud be nice

sensing your own strength (proprioception): although it's far away, maybe this IS possible. the computers strength is its objectified through certain KPI's and this can be feedbacked into a learning system

balance

gravity

# Emotion

pain now
danger: possibility of pain
hurting: pain in the past

pleasure
satisfaction

etc....

it's interesting if we can somehow make the computer use emotions to its benefit. if we are happy, the computer should be happy...

IDK though, but we should not forget about emotion...

# Sleep

Although it's not really a sensation, it's more a brain state... it helps the brain organise its thoughts. Format it better, etc.
