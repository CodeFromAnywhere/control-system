## S2T

Install Speech To Text and connect it to `yo`.

Also save all spoken texts to `Speech` model

For now, the ux depends on whether you speak or type. When a spoken text matches a command and that command is executed, a config should be set to "speech" and `log` should use that config parameter to determine whether the logs should be in the console only or also spoken.
