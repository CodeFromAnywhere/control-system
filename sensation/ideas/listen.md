listen is just a small layer:

- receive input at the microphone 24/7, either through mac mic or through bluetooth earpods, if that's turned on. auto-switch
- low-level processing
  - who's speaking?
  - which language?
  - besides spoken language, what other sounds do we hear?
  - what's the atmosphere like?
  - what is said
    - phonetically (sounds rather than spelled words)
    - word by word (faster)
    - sentence by sentence (higher accuracy)
